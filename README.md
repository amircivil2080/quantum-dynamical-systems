**Quantum dynamics** is the quantum counterpart of classical dynamics. It deals with the motions, energy, and momentum exchanges of systems governed by the laws of quantum mechanics¹. Specifically, it investigates how quantum mechanical observables change over time. In this realm, variables are described as "q-numbers" represented by operators or Hermitian matrices on a Hilbert space. The equation of motion relies on the Hamiltonian (total energy) to anticipate system evolution¹.
